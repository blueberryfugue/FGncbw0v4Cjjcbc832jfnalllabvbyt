<p>
<i>this year, year of modularity and oversaturation, year in which the greenest greens swim nauseatingly across your screen. sing, o year, sing darkly of promise after promise of living and loving amongst the trees, trees, trees, all mediated through screens, screens, screens. grey city pavement crumbling brick all around, blocks upon blocks that i go 'round and 'round pretending to foster sanity, but oh no, it is a kind of madness in its own right to ache to retreat to the comfort of a mediated natural world on my screen. o eternity! lament of digitality! save me from this wretched hypocrisy, so that i may once again feel the earth beneath my feet.</i> </p>

<p>
i began this mini procrastination project as a way to cope with how profoundly unappealing the real and decaying and warming world felt in comparison to the tightly-organised bliss of stardew valley,,,,, however, many weeks passed, i stopped playing, i had some kind of overstimulated breakdown, started having regular nightmares, and faced the end of a very overwhelming year. now i am situated in a quiet pocket at the beginning of january where nothing has quite woken up yet and i have cut an extensive amount of screentime and scrolling out of my life,,,, for now. therefore i present this as a superficial documentation of everything i have consumed towards the end of the year, with the theme of the digital forest becoming now a nod to the troubled and tensioned ways in which we (try to) reconcile the virtual with the real,,,,,, or something to that effect,,,,,,,  </p>

<p>
thus: becoming one with the forest, living sustainably on this earth, where is the earth? is it in my computer? hypertext-as-forest, network as symbiotic relationships. breathe the cool piney air of html and unethical mineral mining. click away, to click is to live and to breathe and to be. the database <i>is</i> the reality that unfolds before your eyes. the food on  your plate, where is it from? is it from my computer? where is my real life? which ones are my friends and which ones are code? what am i?
